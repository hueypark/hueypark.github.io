<p>Especially as you move into management and leadership, it's ultimately how well you engage with your key stakeholders
more often and more deeply that will have the biggest impact on your ability to deliver your desired output and create impact.

<blockquote>
<p>Intrinsic or Teachable?</p>
<p>First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable?
If you take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be taller.
Do we first and foremost need to select for “high standards” people?
If so, this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so.
I believe high standards are teachable.
In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure.
High standards are contagious.
Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt.
The opposite is also true.
If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread.
And though exposure works well to teach high standards,
I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards,
which I hope to share in this letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During our hiring meetings, we ask people to consider three questions before making a decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you admire this person? If you think about the people you’ve admired in
your life, they are probably people you’ve been able to learn from or take an
example from. For myself, I’ve always tried hard to work only with people I
admire, and I encourage folks here to be just as demanding. Life is definitely too
short to do otherwise.</li>
<li>Will this person raise the average level of effectiveness of the group they’re
entering? We want to fight entropy. The bar has to continuously go up. I ask
people to visualize the company 5 years from now. At that point, each of us
should look around and say, “The standards are so high now &ndash; boy, I’m glad I got
in when I did!”</li>
<li>Along what dimension might this person be a superstar? Many people have
unique skills, interests, and perspectives that enrich the work environment for all
of us. It’s often something that’s not even related to their jobs. One person here
is a National Spelling Bee champion (1978, I believe). I suspect it doesn’t help
her in her everyday work, but it does make working here more fun if you can
occasionally snag her in the hall with a quick challenge: “onomatopoeia!”</li>

<p>Right guide for forming a team.</p>
<p>Tasks should be assigned in much greater detail for each role, goal, and process, with the goal of communicating
frequently and gaining understanding through task performance.</p>
<p>Spend much more time explaining roles, goals, and processes with the expectation that they won't ask questions or voice
their opinions until they feel comfortable, and actively check in with them to see if they don't understand or need
clarification. Intentionally do a lot of activities to create a sense of security and bonding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way.
Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer.
So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow.
And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive.
And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer.</p>
