# Bevy 101 - ECS 부터 itch.io 배포까지

---

## 박재완

- 여러 게임회사를 다닌 후
- 지금은 [OLAP 데이터베이스](http://abit.ly/luft) 개발하고 있음
- Bevy 로 캐주얼 게임 만들기 시도 중

---

## 목차

- Bevy Game Engine 기초
- itch.io 에 게임 배포하기

---

## Bevy

- A refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust
- Free and Open Source Forever!

https://bevyengine.org/

---

## Bevy 주요 기능

- Data Driven
- 2D, 3D Renderer, Render Graph, Animation
- Cross Platform
- Bevy UI
- Scenes
- Sound
- Hot Reloading
- Productive Compile Times
- Free and Open Source

---

### Data Driven

All engine and game logic uses Bevy ECS, a custom Entity Component System

- Fast: Massively Parallel and Cache-Friendly. The fastest ECS according to some benchmarks
- Simple: Components are Rust structs, Systems are Rust functions
- Capable: Queries, Global Resources, Local Resources, Change Detection, Lock-Free Parallel Scheduler

---

```rust
#[derive(Component)]
struct Player;

fn system(
    q: Query&lt;(Entity, &amp;Player)&gt;
) {
}
```

Bevy Component 와 System

일단 넘어가겠습니다.

---

## Bevy Warning

&gt; Bevy is still in the early stages of development.

https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy?tab=readme-ov-file#warning

---

&lt;!-- ## Bevy Hello World

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_systems(Startup, hello_world)
        .run();
}

fn hello_world() {
    println!(&#34;Hello World!&#34;);
}
```

--- --&gt;

## Bevy ECS

---

## 일반적인 ECS

---

## [Entity component system in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)

- Entity–component–system (ECS) is a software architectural pattern mostly used in video game development for the representation of game world objects.
- An ECS comprises entities composed from components of data, with systems which operate on the components.

---

## [History of ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#History)

- In 1998, Thief: The Dark Project pioneered an ECS.
- ...
- In October 2018 the company Unity released its megacity demo that utilized a tech stack built on an ECS.

---

## [Go Generic 으로 만들어본 ECS 시스템](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FylHURMCpPU&amp;t=410s)

- MVC 패턴과 비슷한 것 같기도 하지만
- 디커플링이 목적이 아니라
- **성능 향상이 목적**

---

## Unity

- [ECS for Unity](https://unity.com/ecs)
    - Game code based on an ECS architecture pattern can avoid the drawbacks of object-oriented programming with GameObjects.
    - And by leveraging game code based on ECS, Burst Compiler, and the C# Job System, development teams can maximize the performance of target platform hardware resources at the memory and CPU level.

---

## Unreal Engine

- [Engine Level ECS System Needed](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/engine-level-ecs-system-needed/499939/2)
    - TL;DR Unreal does take benefit of CPU threads.
    - It does already uses ECS where it makes sense, instead of forcing everyone to some trend.

---

## [Bevy ECS](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_ecs)

- Bevy ECS is an Entity Component System custom-built for the Bevy game engine.
- It aims to be simple to use, ergonomic, fast, massively parallel, opinionated, and featureful.
- It was created specifically for Bevy&#39;s needs, but it can easily be used as a standalone crate in other projects

---

## [Bevy ECS Concepts](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_ecs#concepts)

- Bevy ECS Concepts 중 핵심적인 몇가지 소개
    - Components
    - Entities
    - Systems
- 이 외에도 Worlds, Schedules 등의 개념이 있음

---

### [Components](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_ecs#components)

- Components are normal Rust structs.
- They are data stored in a World and specific instances of Components correlate to Entities.

```rust
use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }
```

---

### [Entities](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_ecs#entities)

- Entities are unique identifiers that correlate to zero or more Components.

```rust
use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }

#[derive(Component)]
struct Velocity { x: f32, y: f32 }

let mut world = World::new();

let entity = world
    .spawn((Position { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }, Velocity { x: 1.0, y: 0.0 }))
    .id();

let entity_ref = world.entity(entity);
let position = entity_ref.get::&lt;Position&gt;().unwrap();
let velocity = entity_ref.get::&lt;Velocity&gt;().unwrap();
```

---

### [Systems](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/crates/bevy_ecs#systems)

- Systems are normal Rust functions.
- Thanks to the Rust type system, Bevy ECS can use function parameter types to determine what data needs to be sent to the system.
- It also uses this &#34;data access&#34; information to determine what Systems can run in parallel with each other.

```rust
use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }

fn print_position(query: Query&lt;(Entity, &amp;Position)&gt;) {
    for (entity, position) in &amp;query {
        println!(&#34;Entity {:?} is at position: x {}, y {}&#34;, entity, position.x, position.y);
    }
}
```

## OOP vs ECS

- [Build Your First Game in Bevy and Rust - Step by Step Tutorial](https://youtu.be/E9SzRc9HkOg)

---

### OOP

```csharp
class Entity: Object {
    public int id;
    public Vector3 position;
    public Vector3 velocity;

    public void applyVelocity(float dt) {
        position &#43;= velocity * dt;
    }
}
```

---

### ECS

``` rust
// Entity
struct Entity {
    id: i32,
}

// Component
struct Transform {
    position: Vec3,
}

// System
fn velocity_system(
    query: Query&lt;(&amp;mut Transform, &amp;Velocity)&gt;) {
}
```

## 자! 이제 Bevy 로 게임을 만들었습니다.

## 그 다음은? 배포!

---

## 주요 고려사항

1. 사용자가 접근하기 쉬워야 함
2. 개발자가 쉽게 사용할 수 있어야 함
3. 배포 주기가 짧아야 함

---

## 플랫폼들

- Google Play
- App Store
- Steam
- 자체 배포
- ...

---

## itch.io

- itch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games.

https://itch.io/

---

## 왜 itch.io 인가?

1. 사용자가 접근하기 쉬워야 함
    - 다운로드 없이 웹에서 바로 실행됨
2. 개발자가 쉽게 사용할 수 있어야 함
    - 하루 정도 걸려서 배포 성공
3. 배포 주기가 짧아야 함
    - GitHub 에서 자동화된 배포 가능

---

## GitHub Actions

- Automate your workflow from idea to production

https://github.com/features/actions

---

## Butler

butler is a small command-line tool that lets you:

- Upload builds of your games quickly &amp; reliably to itch.io
- Generate patches and apply them offline
- Run a few other utility commands

https://github.com/itchio/butler

---

## Bevy 로 itch.io 배포하기

1. Checkout code
2. Install Rust toolchain
3. Install wasm related tools
4. Install butler
5. Upload package to Itch.io
